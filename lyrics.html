					<h2 id="soundhead">City Lights</h2>
					<p>
						I see the city sleeping, the high rise sky run from the light. I see her dancing on top of the world through the puddles at night. Tonight, I couldn't find myself tonight. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. I was born underneath that urban sky. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. I creep the boulevards, the avenues they can take me far. And I'm standing still through the city hue under the stars. Tonight, I couldn't find myself tonight. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. I was born underneath that urban sky. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. City Lights.

					<h2 id="soundhead">Waiting for the World</h2>
					<p>
						I see the sunshine, fighting off the rays. You will not take me onto better days. I saw you turning years before that rage. It left me burning, do you tell me what to say? I'm still waiting for the world. Yeah, we're always waiting for the world. I see the leaves fall, dancing downward days. You can't believe it, critics all the rave. I felt the outskirts crashing through your waves. It left me holding a candle in your gaze. I'm still waiting for the world. We're always waiting for the world. No one ever told me, it was the world. We're always waiting for the world.
					</p><br>
					<h2 id="soundhead">You</h2>
					<p>
						I sit awake wondering where you might be, are you coming home today? I wash the blood from my hands into the sink, I try and wash you away.  So many times I had to look but you were gone, so many times you could've changed. So ashamed of who I was when I was there, so many years I could've saved. And I lost everything I had, my soul could not find a way. I lost everything to you, this bittered world took me away. You - are you fine? (Alone I wait for you awake in bed). You - still bleed on my mind (I wash my hands of you, the sink turns red). You - wanted more that time, but I would've stayed for life. This only hope, this only dream, they're dying away cause I know you're dying too. You had the world, you had the face of another day, I'm the only light that could ever shine through on you. I lost everything I had, my soul could not find its way, I lost everything to you, this bittered world took me away. You - are you fine? You - still bleed on my mind. You - wanted more that time, but I would've stayed for life. You, you, you, you...

					<h2 id="soundhead">Trigger Happy</h2>
					<p>
						I got trouble, yeah it came for me one sunny day it glared so much I could not see the police outside with their guns drawn, I took my 45 and did what had to be done. I shot my way out of this place, I shot my way out of this place and take that money - go! Let's shoot our way out of this place, take that money - go! And we'll get away. Have you got trouble with the CIA, the FBI, IRS, NSA. If trouble came would you do the same, take your 45 and blow out all their brains. Let's shoot our way out of this place and take that money - go! The bullets flew so fast by my head yes they did, with trigger happy eyes I knew I'd survive, next time I'll get my M-16 and hold on tight, so tight, and we'll get away. Trigger happy days!!
