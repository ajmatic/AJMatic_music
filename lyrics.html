					<h2 id="soundhead">City Lights</h2>
					<p>
						I see the city sleeping, the high rise sky run from the light. I see her dancing on top of the world through the puddles at night. Tonight, I couldn't find myself tonight. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. I was born underneath that urban sky. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. I creep the boulevards, the avenues they can take me far. And I'm standing still through the city hue under the stars. Tonight, I couldn't find myself tonight. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. I was born underneath that urban sky. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. City Lights.

					<h2 id="soundhead">Waiting for the World</h2>
					<p>
						I see the sunshine, fighting off the rays. You will not take me onto better days. I saw you turning years before that rage. It left me burning, do you tell me what to say? I'm still waiting for the world. Yeah, we're always waiting for the world. I see the leaves fall, dancing downward days. You can't believe it, critics all the rave. I felt the outskirts crashing through your waves. It left me holding a candle in your gaze. I'm still waiting for the world. We're always waiting for the world. No one ever told me, it was the world. We're always waiting for the world.
					</p><br>
					<!--<h2 id="soundhead">Shame</h2>
					<p>
						Running around all over town, it's always, always on the other side I can feel your desire, it's just a phase now. You believed in getting it done, but the taste in my mouth leaves me numb. Cause no one stays leaving the blame, taking the reigns and pushing the shame. I couldn't see that you had to be free for everything now. It was just to late for the ways to wait and now I've become you, you believed in letting it go. And now that time has passed on low. Cause no one stays leaving the blame and holding the pain, while taking the reigns and pushing the shame.  
					</p>
					<h2 id="soundhead">Roads to You</h2>
					<p>
						I wouldn't mind just a little more time to take this thing on down the line, which road should I take to you now. Somewhere down in a sleepy little town, got your pictures all around, which road should I take to you now, to you. The low road, the high road, the one that leads me home to you. Where have all the people gone that I used to know. We wanted it all, wanted it all. We, wouldn't think twice about where we'd fall. And all I know is how to fold,
