					<h2 id="lyrichead">City Lights</h2>
					<p>
						I see the city sleeping, the high rise sky run from the light. I see her dancing on top of the world through the puddles at night. Tonight, I couldn't find myself tonight. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. I was born underneath that urban sky. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. I creep the boulevards, the avenues they can take me far. And I'm standing still through the city hue under the stars. Tonight, I couldn't find myself tonight. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. I was born underneath that urban sky. I was lost somewhere in those city lights. City Lights. 
					</p><br>
					<!--<h2 id="lyrichead">Roads to You</h2>
					<p>
						I wouldn't mind just a little more time to take this thing on down the line, which road should I take to you now. Somewhere down in a sleepy little town, got your pictures all around, which road should I take to you now, to you. The low road, the high road, the one that leads me home to you. Where have all the people gone that I used to know. We wanted it all, wanted it all. We, wouldn't think twice about where we'd fall. And all I know is how to fold,
