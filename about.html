						I was born and raised in Norwich, CT.  I first picked up the guitar when I was 15 years old and could not put it down.  I remember my fingers bleeding because I played for hours on end.  At that time in my life, my musical influences were bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, Aerosmith, The Guess Who, and most of all Guns N Roses.  Then I started listening to the grunge bands like Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam. I would say at that point in my life I wasn't very opened to different styles of music.
					</p>
					<p>
						After high school I moved to Hollywood, CA where I stayed for several years. I packed a few bags, got on a plane, and headed west, young man! I would categorize my early twenties as my free-spirited and unfettered years.  It was a time where I chose partying over music or anything else for that matter.    I listened to much of the same music in that time period, but the older I got, the more I opened up about the types and styles of music I listened to.  I met some amazing people along the way who also opened my eyes (actually, ears) to genres of music I now enjoy. 
					</p>
					<p>
							
						After leaving L.A. and coming back home, I got back into music and started playing acoustic solo shows at the bars on the Eastern CT shoreline. I started listening to bands I would have never listened to in my early twenties. I will always love my influential roots, but now I am more attuned to all the different varieties and designs of music. 
					</p>
					<p>
						 Los Angeles taught me the importance of exposure and persistence in regards to my own music.  And from traveling around the country and even beyond, I've learned to appreciate the diversity not only in others, but also myself. It's a trait I hope my music reflects and it's a trait I hope I never lose. I believe the depth of a musician's work is largely based on their own experiences and their willingness to communicate those experiences. My songs are me and they tell the evolution of my life thus far. The only thing I can hope for is that one of these songs or even a piece of one of these songs connects with you and you share my experiences, if just for a brief moment.
